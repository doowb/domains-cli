# domains [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/domains.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/domains) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/domains.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/domains)

> Check to see if domain names are available.

## Install

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm install --global domains
```

## Usage

When running the first time, provide an authentication token from [dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com). This will be saved for later runs.

```sh
$ domains example --token XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Specify the hostname of the domains that you want to check. Leave off the tld so the domain can be checked against multiple tlds at once:

```sh
$ domains example
```

By default, `.com` and `.io` are checked. If you want to specify the tlds to check, use the `--tlds` options and a comma separated list of tlds:

```sh
$ domains example --tlds com,io,net
```

You can try multiple domains too:

```sh
$ domains example foo bar baz --tlds com,io,net
```
